## Endless Runner

#### Player Character

**Keyboard Input**

- we can use either 'pygame.key' or event loop.
- when using classes you can the controls inside of the relevant class.
    - pygame.mouse or pygame.key
- event loop is great for more general stuff, like closing the game.

```Python
keys = print(pygame.key.get_pressed()) # access all keys
if keys[pygame.K_SPACE]:
    print("Jump!")
```

```Python 
if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
    if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
        print("Jump!")
```

**Jump and Gravity**

- on mouse click, we have two options:
    - mouse pos/collision => button press => Jump
    - button press => mouse pos/collision => Jump (more efficient)
        - because checking the collision is expensive

```Python
```

**creating a floor and sky**

```Python
    player_gravity += 1
    player_rect.y += player_gravity
    if player_rect.bottom >= 300: player_rect.bottom = 300
    screen.blit(player_surface, player_rect)
```

```Python
if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
    if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE and player_rect.bottom >= 300:
        player_gravity = -20
```
**ending game**

```Python
if snail_rect.colliderect(player_rect):
    pygame.quit()
    exit()
```

**states of game (game over, game win)**
