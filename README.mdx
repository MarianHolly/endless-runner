## Endless Runner

#### Player Character

**Keyboard Input**

- we can use either 'pygame.key' or event loop.
- when using classes you can the controls inside of the relevant class.
    - pygame.mouse or pygame.key
- event loop is great for more general stuff, like closing the game.

```Python
keys = print(pygame.key.get_pressed()) # access all keys
if keys[pygame.K_SPACE]:
    print("Jump!")
```

```Python 
if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
    if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
        print("Jump!")
```

**Jump and Gravity**

- on mouse click, we have two options:
    - mouse pos/collision => button press => Jump
    - button press => mouse pos/collision => Jump (more efficient)
        - because checking the collision is expensive

```Python
```

**creating a floor and sky**

```Python
    player_gravity += 1
    player_rect.y += player_gravity
    if player_rect.bottom >= 300: player_rect.bottom = 300
    screen.blit(player_surface, player_rect)
```

```Python
if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
    if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE and player_rect.bottom >= 300:
        player_gravity = -20
```
**ending game**

```Python
if snail_rect.colliderect(player_rect):
    pygame.quit()
    exit()
```

**states of game (game over, game win)**

**displaying the score (+ measuring time)**
- we want to update score on every frame
- put that on a surface
- dispaly that surface on the screen

```Python
def display_score():
    current_time = int(pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000) - start_time
    snail_surface = text.render("Score: " + str(current_time), False, (65, 65, 65))
    score_rect = snail_surface.get_rect(center = (400, 50))
    screen.blit(snail_surface, score_rect)
```

**transform surfaces**



**better enemy logic (spawning multiple obstacles)**
- we need timer
- we create a custom user event that is triggered in certain time intervals

1. we create a custom event
2. we tell pygame to trigger that event continuously
3. add code in the event loop

1. create a list of obstacle rectangles
2. everytime the timer triggers we add a new rectangle to that list
3. we move every rectangle in the list to the left on every frame
4. we delete the rectangles that are off the screen

**animating the player, the sail and the fly**
- for player animation, we create our own timer that updates the surface
- for the sail and the fly, we rely on the inbuild timers to upadte all obstacle surfaces


**using the sprite class (OOP in Pygame)**

**adding music**
